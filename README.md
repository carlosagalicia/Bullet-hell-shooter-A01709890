# Bullet Hell Shooter

This is a project developed in Unity that implements a "Bullet Hell Shooter" game. The main objective of the game is to dodge projectiles and shoot enemies in a dynamic and challenging environment.

## General Description

- **Project Name:** Bullet Hell Shooter
- **Platform:** Unity
- **Game Style:** Bullet Hell (Shooter)
- **Objective:** Create an exciting experience with multiple enemies, complex shooting patterns, and volumetric graphics.

## Key Learning Areas

1. **Programming in Unity:**
   - Use of **C#** to implement game logic, character control, and shooting patterns.
   - Design of reusable and modular scripts for projectile and enemy controllers.

2. **Graphics and Effects:**
   - Implementation of **Volumetric Lines** to enhance visual effects like shots and laser beams.
   - Use of **Custom Shaders** for advanced graphical effects.
   - Creation of materials and textures to enrich the visual atmosphere.

3. **Game Design:**
   - Development of complex shooting patterns for enemies.
   - Implementation of a wave system to increase difficulty.
   - Use of prefabs to instantiate objects dynamically.

4. **Project Management in Unity:**
   - Efficient organization of folders (`Assets`, `Scripts`, `Prefabs`, etc.).
   - Configuration of **Scene Management** for smooth transitions between levels or game states.

5. **Audio and Sound Effects:**
   - Use of **AudioManager** to manage sound effects and music.
   - Design of reactive audio for gameplay, such as explosions and shots.

## Languages and Technologies Used

- **C#:** Programming language for all game logic.
- **Unity:** Game engine used to create the game.
- **Volumetric Lines:** Graphics package for volumetric lines and effects.
